# week-4-game

This project allows the user to play a fully developed "Crystals Collector Game". The user is given a random number at the start of the game.  There are four crystals below the starting (target) number.  By clicking on a crystal the user will add a specific amount of points to their total score.  The user wins the game by matching their total score to the random (target) number, and the user loses the game if their total score goes above that number.  The value of each crystal is hidden from the user until they click on a specific crystal.  Finally, each time the game restarts, the values of each crystal, and the target number, will change.

This project is useful because it is fully functional due to the referencing of an external JavaScript file that includes JQuery.  Using JavaScript and JQuery as external sources for an HTML file allows a programmer to make many types of games of very degrees of difficulty.  The project is especially useful in that it includes functions that allow for random numbers to be selected for the target number and the individual crystal values using for loops and other functions that are useful in JavaScript.  In addition, it is useful to see how the resetGame function for this game can be applied to games the user might want to create.

The user can get started with this project by first playing the game, then inspecting the game with Chrome Dev Tools.  Looking at the code for the JavaScript and JQuery will allow the user to see the logic behind this game.

If the user wants to get help with making a similar project, I would suggest they study the JavaScript and JQuery functions used in this game, as well as the logic behind the game, which can be seen in the external JavaScript file.

I am the sole contributor to this project.

Thank you for playing!
